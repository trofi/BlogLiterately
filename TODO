* Change project name :]

* Add support for known places (accounts) to post akin ssh does.
  So you could refer to resource you post by blog only URL or
  some short alias if it's not ambiguous.

  I think it's safe to break commandline interface and forbid passing
  username/password from command prompt entirely.

* Add support for grabbing Title, Tags and Category directly from post.
  The starting plan is to add tag support in RST: :title:, :tag:, :category:.

  The more advanced is to make up extraction of tags right from
  article contents (maybe, not worth of it).
